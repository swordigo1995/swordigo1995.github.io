Fast simple calculations is always not enough for solving problems. A good algorithm design is needed. Computational problem solvingknowledge? Declarative knowledge(陈述性知识） statements of factsome definition in math e.g. square root. Imperative knowledge(命令性知识） how to do . a recipehave specific steps Capture a recipe? how to run program(basic machine architecture) program – sequence of instructions(predefined set of primitive instructions) interpreter – change flow of control Turing complete (图灵完备) we can compute anything using six primitives! Programming language characteristicEach programming language provides a set of primitive operations.provides mechanisms(机制) for combining primitives to form complex expressions.provides mechanisms for deducing(推断) meanings or values. Aspects of languages primitives–numbers,strings,simple operators.etc. syntax(语法)–strings of characters and symbols are well-formed . semantics(语义) static semantics – syntactically valid strings have a meaning.full semantics – meaning associated with a syntactically correct string of symbols with no static semantic errors(always have exactly one meaning in programming languages, ambiguous may happen in nature languages) WRONG Syntactic errors - easily cought satic semantic errors-compiled language chech carefully before running.-interpreted language check while interpreting the program. Full semantic errors - don’t have static semantic error, the meaning is not what we intended.","categories":[{"name":"MIT 6.00 STUDY NOTES","slug":"MIT-6-00-STUDY-NOTES","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/MIT-6-00-STUDY-NOTES/"}],"tags":[{"name":"study note","slug":"study-note","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/study-note/"},{"name":"MOOC","slug":"MOOC","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/MOOC/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"MIT 6.00 STUDY NOTES","slug":"MIT-6-00-STUDY-NOTES","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/MIT-6-00-STUDY-NOTES/"}]},{"title":"随笔NO.1","slug":"diary-no-1","date":"2016-11-11T11:11:23.517Z","updated":"2016-11-11T16:51:24.637Z","comments":true,"path":"2016/11/11/diary-no-1/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2016/11/11/diary-no-1/","excerpt":"lalala终于搭好了自己的blog","text":"lalala终于搭好了自己的blog 最近任务好多，自己好乱。 Task List： 优班答辩三页纸 MIT大作业 the last two assignments outdoorAR medianCut实现 MIT online Course 6.00.1X 计算机科学和PYTHON编程导论 6.00.2X 计算思维和数据科学导论 Unity 进阶与 shader 英语六级 反正有几个早晚要做的快点搞定吧。优班 MIT 项目 不要忘了英语啊！！！Oh my poor English.今天是双11:joy:最后来个校徽：）","categories":[{"name":"随笔","slug":"随笔","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/随笔/"}],"tags":[{"name":"心情","slug":"心情","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/心情/"},{"name":"任务","slug":"任务","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/tags/任务/"}],"keywords":[{"name":"随笔","slug":"随笔","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/categories/随笔/"}]},{"title":"Hello World","slug":"hello-world","date":"2013-07-13T12:46:25.000Z","updated":"2016-11-11T11:35:53.468Z","comments":true,"path":"2013/07/13/hello-world/","link":"","permalink":"http://yoursite.com/2013/07/13/hello-world/","excerpt":"Welcome to Hexo!
